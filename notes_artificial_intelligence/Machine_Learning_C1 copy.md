# What is Machine Learning

> Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. (Arthur Samuel 1959)

The more opportunities you give a learning algorithm to learn the better it will perform.

# Learning Algorithm

Learning algorithm is like getting some sets of tools, so we need have great tools and make sure we know how to use it.

- Pick up the right one which can solve the problem effectively.
- Make sure the right implementation of it.

## Supervise Learning

Supervise Learning is the most frequently used algorithm of machine learning. According to recent surveys, supervised learning methods, including regression and classification, are employed in over 70% of machine learning projects, highlighting their widespread application and effectiveness.

X features could be anything from pixel values in an image to words in a text document, and Y labels are the ground truth that the model aims to predict.

| **X (Input)** | **Y (Output)** | **Application**     |
| :------------ | :------------- | :------------------ |
| Email         | Spam or not    | Spam Filtering      |
| Audio         | Text           | Speech Recognition  |
| English       | Chinese        | Machine Translation |

This is an inline formula: <Latex>y = mx + b</Latex>

### Regression

To predict a number infinitely many possible outputs.

e.g. To predict the price of housing in the future
this is an example of supervised learning, because a dataset, the right answer that is the label or the right price on the plots, was provided to algorithm

With those data, someone wants to know what's the price for a 750 square feet house. Then the algorithm will choose the most appropriate line or curve or other thing to fit to this data.
