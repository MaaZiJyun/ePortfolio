# Introduction
## Background

Two years ago, a global pandemic caused chaos worldwide, prompting governments to take strict measures, including home isolation, to curb the spread of the virus. As a result, the traditional face-to-face education model adopted by many academic institutions became impractical during this period. In this unprecedented situation, many institutions and related enterprises faced severe challenges. In response to this crisis, various network applications, such as video conferencing and online education, rapidly gained popularity, and the virtual education model was widely adopted, allowing academic activities to continue despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic.

Now, with the decline of the pandemic era, many educational institutions are returning to traditional face-to-face education models. Interestingly, students who experienced online classes during this period reported that it did not negatively impact their academic qualifications or graduation prospects, as online education credentials are already recognized by the government. While the era of online classes may have formally ended, the profound impact of this education model born out of the pandemic continues to influence educational practices.

As a supplement, many schools have not abolished online classes post-pandemic and use them as a contingency option when teachers or students cannot attend in person.

## Virtual Universities

Due to the extensive use of media applications during the era of online classes, many students jokingly claimed they graduated from "Zoom University" or "Google University" because they were constantly interacting with these applications instead of being on a physical campus. However, this joke aligns with the vision of an internet-based university.

Virtual universities (VUs), or online or network universities, are educational institutions that primarily offer academic programs and courses through digital platforms and the internet. Unlike traditional physical universities, virtual universities deliver educational content electronically, fostering interaction and collaboration between students and faculty through learning management systems (LMS), video conferencing, webinars, discussion forums, and virtual classrooms. These platforms enable students to interact with peers, submit assignments remotely, and receive feedback from professors. Additionally, virtual universities offer flexible learning options, catering to individuals with work or family commitments, international students, and those living in remote areas.

# Overview
## Inflation and the Decline in the Value of Degrees

In economic terms, "inflation" refers to the continuous rise in the general price level, which reduces people's purchasing power. Historically, currency depreciation has been a form of inflation, typically caused by the issuance of paper money in excess of actual demand, leading to devaluation and price increases.

Interestingly, the modern education degree system is similar to the currency system, where the value of a degree is officially recognized and awarded by governments and society, ultimately becoming a crucial indicator for employment opportunities. This can be metaphorically compared to the "currency" of education. However, people are complex, and a degree alone cannot fully define a person, just as price alone cannot fully reflect the true value of an item. Thus, the degree system has limitations in measuring an individual's worth. However, many people ignore this fact due to the excessively high expectations placed on academic qualifications by authoritative institutions.

With the increase in global population and the proliferation of higher education (bachelor's degrees and above), many highly educated individuals are entering the workforce. However, when the number of available jobs in society and businesses cannot keep pace with the rapid increase in qualified candidates, so-called "degree inflation" occurs. People are left to wonder, "Is it meaningful for students to pursue degrees when they are being mass-produced?"

"Why save money when they are printing money?"
Robert Kiyosaki (2021)

Affected by the decline in the value of degrees, society and businesses have expanded their evaluation criteria in the hiring process, seeking candidates with specific skills and qualities rather than solely emphasizing academic qualifications. Additionally, businesses have adjusted their educational requirements for applicants, raising the minimum education level from vocational schools to bachelor's degrees or from bachelor's to master's degrees.

Some companies have established their own evaluation systems, offering certificates different from the traditional ones issued by universities and governments. If the establishment of schools and degree systems by the government is considered "centralization," the changing or raising of standards by companies represents "decentralization" in the hiring process. Objectively, the decentralization of criteria for measuring a person's worth is progressing.

## Academic Centralization and Monopoly

Due to regional development disparities, universities differ in educational resources, equipment, facilities, and funding, leading to varied student learning experiences even within the same discipline. Governments tend to invest in top-tier universities rather than supporting ordinary ones, further extending this imbalance. Additionally, the high social recognition of prestigious universities attracts the interest of companies and social organizations, increasing cooperation opportunities. This tendency creates a cycle where strong schools become stronger, and weaker schools struggle to maintain competitiveness.

Most undergraduate education typically lasts 4-5 years, occupying a significant part of one's life. This period is sufficient to become an expert in a specific field. Naturally, this period widens the gap between students from prestigious universities and those from ordinary universities. Students from prestigious universities benefit from abundant educational resources, excelling and becoming more powerful in academic pursuits. In contrast, students from mediocre universities may find it difficult to access such opportunities, limiting their potential development.

However, more regrettable than the inequality among universities is the situation of students who cannot attend university. Many universities' admission policies are based on standardized national exams. For instance, in China, high school students must take the College Entrance Examination (CEE) and be selected based on their scores. However, while the university metrics change slowly, the increase in high school examinees exacerbates this issue, with more people entering the battlefield and sharing the same cake.

## The Futility of University Education

In reality, the slow progress of university reforms contrasts with businesses' rapid self-adjustment. Many students complain that they cannot find jobs after graduation because most skills demanded by society are not learned in university.

A survey conducted by Gallup and the Strada Education Network in 2018 found that considering debt and the benefits obtained, about half of American college graduates felt that their education was not worth it. Additionally, various surveys and studies emphasize how employers perceive university education and job preparedness. Notably, a joint study by the American Association of Colleges and Universities (AAC&U) and Hart Research Associates reported that the majority of employers believed new college graduates were inadequately prepared for the workforce. In other words, both businesses and students believe that the modern university education system is not very useful for individuals.

The disparity between university education and the specific needs of businesses may be due to many universities being uniformly managed by government education departments, lacking diverse management. Furthermore, with a limited number of universities compared to businesses, it is impossible for universities to educate diverse students based on business demands. This inherent contradiction between "unification" and "diversification" makes it a significant challenge to align university curricula with the diverse needs of businesses.

In recent years, the role of universities has been a topic of intense debate. Many are concerned that universities are losing their effectiveness, and investors in higher education believe that trust in higher education is declining. This stems from universities transforming from institutions dedicated to education and personal development into entities that commodify degrees. The decline in the value of modern degrees, the encouragement of knowledge sharing, and the academic commercialization model, which requires significant investment of funds and time, may persist but are also likely to be challenged by new education markets.

Surprisingly, the impact of the global pandemic in 2020 offered the possibility of another form of university. This possibility is referred to as "virtual universities" or "network universities," providing more cost-effective and economical options.

# Discussion

Virtual universities can effectively avoid some inherent drawbacks of traditional university education models. Firstly, they do not require centralized management, reducing administrative complexities. Secondly, online education alleviates issues of classroom and dormitory overcrowding, enabling a more personalized learning experience. Thirdly, geographical and time constraints are significantly reduced, allowing students to access educational resources from nearly anywhere. Lastly, the cost of online courses is usually lower, making higher education accessible to more people.

## Advantages of Virtual Universities

Virtual universities offer many advantages, particularly in terms of flexibility and convenience. Learners can adjust their study schedules freely, balancing education, work, family responsibilities, and other commitments. Accessibility is also a significant benefit, with online learning breaking geographical barriers and enabling students from diverse backgrounds to receive high-quality education.

Individualized learning is a prominent feature of online courses, using adaptive learning technology and customized content to cater to individual learning preferences and needs. Cost-efficiency is another attractive aspect, as tuition fees for online courses are generally lower, and expenses related to commuting, accommodation, and on-campus facilities are eliminated. These digital institutions offer a wide range of courses, including specialized courses not available at traditional educational institutions.

Virtual classrooms promote interactive learning through real-time discussions, chats, and video conferencing, enhancing student engagement. For professionals aiming for career development, online learning enables them to pursue higher education without quitting their jobs, improving their career prospects. Additionally, online platforms provide a continuous learning environment, with access to course materials, resources, and recorded lectures, fostering self-directed learning.

Global network education is a natural byproduct of online education, facilitating exchanges between students from different countries and cultures, promoting diverse perspectives and international cooperation. Furthermore, virtual universities encourage lifelong learning, allowing individuals to continuously improve their skills throughout their careers. The digital environment hones students' technical abilities, enabling them to utilize various online tools and platforms proficiently. Moreover, online education reduces the carbon footprint of physical campuses, contributing to a greener future.

## Concerns about Virtual Universities

As virtual universities develop, there are concerns that the importance of traditional university models may be undermined, leading to potential unemployment issues for academic and administrative staff, including professors, lecturers, and administrators. However, the operation of virtual universities still requires the continuous involvement of faculty and administrative professionals, with their uniqueness lying in the transition to a vocational platform. Outstanding scholars from different academic institutions can contribute to shared digital education platforms, breaking the hegemony of prestigious universities and renowned professors, ultimately achieving educational equality.

There are also concerns that the use of clubs, libraries, and laboratories, which are essential parts of university life, may reduce learning opportunities for virtual university students. In reality, virtual universities symbolize a treasure trove of knowledge and are not limited to online presence; they closely collaborate with various offline organizations and institutions. The absence of a physical campus does not prevent students from participating in club activities or using library and laboratory facilities. Instead, students are offered diverse choices beyond the constraints of traditional campuses. Furthermore, due to the dispersed demand of students, related industries such as libraries and laboratories are expected to emerge in large numbers and be established in various locations, promoting the birth of new businesses and opening up further career paths.

By merging the dynamics of academia and society in this manner, the cooperative relationship between universities and societal progress is strengthened. Simultaneously, this phenomenon of dispersion helps widely disseminate educational resources, achieve educational fairness, and weaken the educational monopoly of prestigious academic institutions. The emergence of innovative education models encourages the expansion of related sectors, leading to the proliferation of economic opportunities and the formation of a vibrant professional environment. Clearly, the interaction between virtual and physical education models expands the dissemination of education, stimulates economic growth, and promotes a close connection between academia and the broader society.

Supplement: Currently, many students extend their learning environments to places like libraries and cafes, and many businesses have established study rooms, promoting diversity.

# Conclusion

The advantages of virtual universities are profound. Their flexibility and convenience allow students to adjust educational resources and remove geographical constraints, promoting global cooperation and networking. Learning through "private customization" using AI technology reduces costs, enhancing educational adaptability and cost-effectiveness. Interactive virtual classrooms encourage student participation, and a diverse range of courses caters to students' professional interests. Moreover, the potential impact on traditional academia and employment issues is nuanced. Virtual universities increase opportunities to access excellent educators and facilities, promoting equality among different schools. The collaboration between virtual universities and offline institutions facilitates the dispersion of educational resources, strengthens the relationship between academia and society, and fosters a more comprehensive, equitable, and vibrant educational ecosystem. This evolution stimulates the development of related industries, creates new opportunities, and ultimately promotes the progress of education and society as a whole.
