# Objectives

Understand the **architecture** and components of decentralized applications, including both **front-end** and **back-end**, which supported by **blockchain technology**.

Plan, design, implement and test end-to-end DApps with proper blockchain network configuration in enterprise scale.

Critically review the newly emerging blockchain standards and architectures, and apply them in various use cases. (Practical)

## Turning Completeness

In computability theory, a system of data-manipulation rules is said to be Turing-complete or computationally universal if it can be used to simulate any Turing machine. This means that <u>this system is able to recognize or decode other data-manipulation rule sets.</u>
