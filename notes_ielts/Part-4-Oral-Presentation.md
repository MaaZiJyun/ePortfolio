## Preparing your presentation 

#### 1. Assessing the situation 

- Topic in your area
- Topic that interests and that we want to know more about

#### 2. Brainstorming 

> Brainstorming is a situation where a group of people meet to generate new ideas and solutions around a specific domain of interest by removing inhibitions. People are able to think more freely and they suggest as many spontaneous new ideas as possible.

> Hello, everyone! (in a short way)
> Good morning/afternoon/evening! It's my pleasure to give you a short speech here. (in a long way)

If there are many subtopics in your topic, you'd better to introduce them to the audience in order.

## Delivering your speech

1. Pronunciation
2. Body language
3. Degree of formality
4. Pacing

## Preparing Visuals 

I wouldn't recommend you to make everything about PPT, even patterns. There are many resources available on the internet, and they are completely free to everyone. Therefore, you the only thing you need do is to copy your information on the basis of completing the speech draft to the template you downloaded, and revise a appropriate layout.

But working with a template doesn't mean everything will be all right. Here are some things that need your attention:

**1. Choose the correct size**

try to set the size fit in the electronic equipment you will use for display, and ensure that your pictures and text will not fly over the screen.

**2. Avoid the use of "text points" and try to replace it with different pictures**

Wait, why? Because IIBC proves that pictures are more acceptable than texts. 

**3. use pictures and diagrams as many as possible**

Compared with text, images are easier to understand and analyse

**4. Choose the style you like**

**5. Put the text in the upper position**

Sometimes, you can see some students standing up to read the PPT content in class that because some texts are too low so the audience at the back of room may not be able to see it clearly.

**6. You need a "progress bar" or page number to display the PPT**

It can show you and the audience where your speech has progressed.

**7. Highlight the most important part of the text**

**8. The screen goes black when telling a story**

in order to create an atmosphere for the audience to listen to the story attentively
