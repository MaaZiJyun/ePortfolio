## 1. Introduction

We, as humans, communicate with various people every day. For someone, having a conversation with others, including strangers, does not seem to be a difficult task, However, for some people, it seems to be a stressful experience. For those who do not so well, there must be some useful skills.

In this section, we're going to talk about how to start, maintain, and end a conversation.

## 2. Start a Conversation

Let's see a few ways you can use in starting a discussion:

1. Using greetings and introductions
2. Talking about your surroundings
3. Making a small talk

### 2.1. Using greetings and introductions

Simple and common greetings, like:

- *Hello*
- *Good morning/ afternoon/ evening*
- *How are you?*
- *How do you do (formal way)*
- *What's up (informal way)*

And you also can add some information about yourself, like:

- *How do you do? I'm Apple.*
- *Pleased to meet you Apple. My name is Banana.*
- *Hello, I'm Mango. May I have your name?*
- *Hi, you look familiar. Have we met before?*

Introduction also can involve introducing people to each other.

- *Apple, let me introduce you to Mango, my old classmate.*
- *This is Strawberry. He used to stay next door to me.*
- *I'd like to introduce you to Cheese. we are colleagues.*

### 2.2. Talking about your surroundings

Talking about your surroundings is another way to start a conversation. The topics on the surroundings should be related to the context of your discussion.

- *Such a long queue, isn't it?*
- *Don't you think the painting is pretty?*
- *What a noisy place, isn't it?*

### 2.3. Making a small talk

One useful conversation skill we should learn is to start a discussion by making small talk. Normally accepted topics include work, study, the weather, news, and life.

- *Was the traffic heavy on the highway?
  *
- *Is there water rationing at your place?*
- *Did you hear about the news that...?*



## 3. Maintain a Conversation

Once a conversation has been started, you should develop and maintain it.

There are a few ways in remaining a conversation:

1. Using fillers
2. Using encouraging expressions
3. Asking questions
4. Highlighting what you have heard
5. Disclosing information about yourself

### 3.1. Using fillers

Fillers can help you break the silence and stall for time while you search for ideas or the right words.

- *Anyway...*
- *Well...*
- *You know...*
- *I'm not sure, but... I think ...
  *
- *Err, let me see...*
- *What I'm trying to tell you is...*

### 3.2. Using encouraging expressions

If the person you talking with is shy or introverted or lacks the motivation of talking, you should keep the talk going by encouraging them.

- *Uh-huh...*
- *Mmm...*
- *Really?*
- *Is it?*
- *I see*
- *Is that right?*
- *Carry on*
- *You're right*
- *That's nice.*
- *How interesting (interesting)*
- *You've got the point there.*

### 3.3. Asking questions

There are 2 types of questions: open-ended and close-ended questions.

Open-ended questions beginning with What, How and Why encourage the others you talking with to give more information.

- *What do you think about this course?*
- *How was your summer holiday?*
- *Why did you come for that activity?*

Close-ended questions only require 'Yes' or 'No' or one-word or two-word responses as an answer.

- *Do you like this course?*
- *When did you come to Malaysia?*
- *How long have you been doing this job?*

### 3.4. Highlighting

You can catch the point that the people are interested in and refer them to discuss the topic deeper.

- *Earlier you seemed interested when I told you about...*
- *A moment ago I heard you say... (I've just heard that...)*

or just repeat the keyword or phrase of what the people just said.

- *I'm doing a course in Landscaping and Design. - **Landscaping and Design**?*

or auxiliaries:

- *do/don't, does/doesn't, have/haven't, can/can't ...*
- *I didn't take any notes during the sessions. - Didn't you?*

### 3.5. Disclosing information about yourself

You can just share your information about your personal thought or experience which are directly related to the topic in the current conversation.

- *A: Where are you from?*
- *B: Arizona, USA. It's hot there all year long, but very dry.*
- *A: Oh, I heard about that place. I have a friend studying there but I've never been there before. I'd like to visit her someday.*



## 4. Close a Conversation

In some situations, there are some signals that tell us to end the conversation naturally, for example, when the bus/subway/train arrives, or a meeting/class/course/lecture/appointment begins.

- *Oh, here's the bus!*
- *Seems the meeting is starting now*

In other situations where we do not have such signals for natural closing, we may think about how to close a conversation more comfortable. A politely ending usually involves 3 steps:

1. Pre-closing
2. Closing
3. Taking leave

### 4.1. Pre-closing

- *Well...*
- *So, ...*
- *Well, okay ...*
- *Look at the tie...*
- *I know you're busy ...*

### 4.2. Closing

- *I gotta go.*
- *I really need to leave now.*
- *I'm afraid I've got to leave now. It's getting late.*
- *I've to get back to work/ meet someone/ take my course now*

### 4.3. Taking leave

- *Good-bye*
- *See you later/ next time/ tomorrow*
- *Good day (formal)*
- *Have a nice day!*

If you are in a formal situation, you can end the conversation by the steps below:

1. Summarising the content
2. Give the reasons for leaving
3. Showing your appreciation
4. Expressing interest to meet again
