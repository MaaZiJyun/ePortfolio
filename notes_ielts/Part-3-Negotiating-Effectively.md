**What is negotiation?** 

Negotiation is the communication process that include two or more parties meet with hope of getting something from the other party or parties. 

When we negotiate we try to get what we want from the other party by offering something in exchanging. We would meet with to find out what the other party wants and to discuss how these interests can be met.

Simply, you can use the following patterns to help you plan for success in negotiation:

- Understand the issues involved
- Know yourself totally, whatever the strengths or weakness
- Know your opponents as better as possible including strengths and weakness
- Understand the process of negotiation
- Use the power of verbal and non-verbal communication

## First of All: Preparing for Negotiation

### 1. Identifying issues for negotiation

> Issues are the content of negotiation.

As an effective negotiator, you need to be able to identify the obvious issues and other related ones for discussion. you also need to predict issues of concern to the other party.

### 2. Considering time and effort to be invested

Apart from identifying the issues, you need to think about the time and effort that you wish to spend for negotiation. If the negotiation held to long, goodwill and possible opportunities for you to gain more interests are lost.

However, it's not means all negotiations should be just short. But, normally, the longer negotiation you hold, the greater risks of losing morale, trust and goodwill between you and other you take.

### 3. Gathering information and identifying negotiation strategies

Your Positions:

- What strategies can I use?
- What are the obstacles involved?
- How can I persuade them to see my point of view?

The Other Party's Positions:

- What strategies would they use?
- What defence would they use?
- What information might they use against me?
